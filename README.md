This is an Angular app I made to be the home page of my personal website

It's pretty simple - main functionalty is just to link to other apps I'm builidng, and to my LinkedIn and GitHub

One thing that's pretty interesting - if you look in the console you'll see an error and redirect to 404.  That's on purpose.  Chceck it out:  https://v17.angular.io/guide/deployment

To run this page, you can just pull it, run npm install, then npm run start
